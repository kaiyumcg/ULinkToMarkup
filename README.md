# ULinkToMarkup
A small utility to convert youtube links in a text file to markup language for github publishing

###### Usage
1. Make a text file that contains youtube links as shown in "sampleData" directory
2. Open up "UlinkToMarkup.exe"
3. Set the text file and your own [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) key.
4. Hit process
5. Save file and done! 
###### For now you need the text file. This part is manual. For next release, I wish to automate this part(categorizeYoutube or something like that based on keywords), so you can just hit process and sit back and relax, tool will do all the things based on your keyword rules
